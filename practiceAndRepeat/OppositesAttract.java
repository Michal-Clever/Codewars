//            Timmy & Sarah think they are in love,
//            but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each.
//                    If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
//
//            Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.
